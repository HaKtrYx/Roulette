Roulette Game

This is a simple roulette game made in Python. It's a fun little project that I worked on to practice my coding skills. Even though I'm still learning, I'll try my best to explain how it works. 

How to Play
When you run the code, it will show you your starting balance of 1000 (imaginary money, of course!). Then, it will ask you to place your bets on different options like red, black, even, odd, rows, and number ranges.
Just enter the amount you want to bet on each option(note that empty imputs end up in an error). The game will calculate your total bet and spin the roulette wheel (which is just a random number generator behind the scenes).
If the lucky number matches any of the options you bet on, you'll win! The game will show you how much you won or lost, and your balance will be updated accordingly. The game is over once ur balance hits 0.

If you're a fellow student like me, feel free to play around with the code and see if you can improve or add new features to the game. Happy coding!
